Wait for me, and I'll come back! 
Wait with all you've got! 
Wait, when dreary yellow rains 
Tell you, you should not. 
Wait when snow is falling fast, 
Wait when summer's hot, 
Wait when yesterdays are past, 
Others are forgot. 
Wait, when from that far-off place, 
Letters don't arrive. 
Wait, when those with whom you wait 
Doubt if I'm alive. 

Wait for me, and I'll come back! 
Wait in patience yet 
When they tell you off by heart 
That you should forget. 
Even when my dearest ones 
Say that I am lost, 
Even when my friends give up, 
Sit and count the cost, 
Drink a glass of bitter wine 
To the fallen friend - 
Wait! And do not drink with them! 
Wait until the end! 

Wait for me and I'll come back, 
Dodging every fate! 
"What a bit of luck!" they'll say, 
Those that would not wait. 
They will never understand 
How amidst the strife, 
By your waiting for me, dear, 
You had saved my life. 
Only you and I will know 
How you got me through. 
Simply - you knew how to wait - 
No one else but you.
